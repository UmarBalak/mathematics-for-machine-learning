# Mathematics for Machine Learning – Notes, Code & Theory

A repository for in-depth study of core mathematics that underpins classical machine learning, starting with Tivadar Danka’s “Mathematics of Machine Learning” but intended to grow with further references and content over time.

## Current Book Structure

* Part 1: Linear Algebra
* Part 2: Calculus
*  Part 3: Multivariable Calculus
*  Part 4: Probability Theory

## Repo Organization

- `linear-algebra/` – Notes, code, and exercises for Part 1 chapters
- `calculus/` – Notes and code for single-variable calculus
- `multivariable-calculus/` – Multivariable treatment and notebooks
- `probability/` – Probability & statistics code and summaries
- `README.md` – Always up-to-date overview, structure, and plans

## Growth Plan

This repository will not be limited to a single book. As mathematical understanding deepens or new resources are explored, you can add new folders, books, or structured content and update the Table of Contents in this README.
